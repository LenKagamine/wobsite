I'm an aspiring software developer who listens to music all day. Wherever I am, I strive to learn more about the world I live in and apply that knowledge to make something new.

Ever since I was young, I've had a keen interest in mathematics and logic. I was that one odd kid in class that did math problems or read the dictionary in his spare time. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, always ready to learn something new. Over time, my love for math evolved into one for computer science and technology. I have dabbled in numerous ways, such as physics simulations, platform games, and web development, and I don't plan on slowing down any time soon.

I love coding, computers, music, and gaming. I tend to take inspiration from my interests and apply them in my projects. Whenever I'm not writing code, I'm usually listening to music, wondering what to create next, or blowing some steam with games. Even when there's no computer present, I brainstorm new creations. Even when there's no music, there's always a melody playing in my brain.

I'm always passionate about learning new concepts, and understanding how makes everything tick, whether it be mechanical, or digital, or both. Taking it one step further, I'll often try to take what I have learned and use it to form my own creations. My favourite way of learning a new tool or idea is to get my hands dirty and create something new. I hope to never stop learning, and to always learn something new and broaden my knowledge of technology and engineering.

This website showcases some of my projects, some of which I've made for school assignments, while others for amusement and as a learning experience. They vary from web development, games, to working with hardware. Hope you enjoy your stay!
