I'm an aspiring software developer who listens to music all day. Wherever I am, I strive to learn more about the world I live in and apply that knowledge to make something new.

Ever since I was young, I've had a keen interest in mathematics and logic. I was that one odd kid in class that did math problems or read the dictionary in his spare time. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, always ready to learn something new. Over time, my love for math evolved into one for computer science and technology. I have dabbled in numerous ways, such as physics simulations, platform games, and web development, and I don't plan on slowing down any time soon.
