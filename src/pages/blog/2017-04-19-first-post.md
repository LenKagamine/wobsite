Hello world!

Welcome to my blog! Here I'll be writing about my experiences in life and in programming.

Ever since I started this website, I’ve wanted to write a blog, but working on the website and getting used to my first year in university left me little time to do so. Now with two semesters over, I can begin my progress.

Among the projects displayed on my website, there are some that I’ve had a lot to write about. This made their descriptions quite lengthy, so hopefully I can tidy them up by moving most of the content here.
