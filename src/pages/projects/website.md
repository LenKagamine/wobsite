### About

Welcome to my website!

I started this website as a place to organize my various projects into one place. I wanted some sort of online portfolio where I could showcase my work for jobs or hackathons. It has gone under several design changes, and I try to regularly update it with new projects. It is also the home of my blog [available here](/blog), which features rambles about life and programming.

I've spent a long time making it responsive and mobile-friendly. It also features smooth page transitions for any links within the website. By the way, have you tried clicking that lightbulb in the top left corner?

### Development

Originally, this website was built using Jekyll and was hosted with Github pages (which has built-in integration with Jekyll sites). The source code for the old website is available at [/lenkagamine.github.io](https://github.com/LenKagamine/lenkagamine.github.io). I've since rewrote it in Gatsby, and I wrote a blog post about the port [here](/blog/gatsby).
