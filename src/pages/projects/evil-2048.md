### About

A clone of 2048 where the game is fighting back! Tiles are placed in the most inconvenient places to hinder your progress towards 2048.

The AI solver is implemented with expectimax, assuming that the tile generation is random. When the AI assumes evil tiles (i.e. the worst tile generation), it performs marginally better.

The evil tiles is implemented with minimax, assuming that the player plays as best as it can.
